A personal portfolio website built to present my work, background, and contact information in a visually engaging way. The site uses scroll-driven animations, a 3D globe, a real-time contact form, and a dark/light theme system with three selectable accent colours.

---

## Architecture Overview

This is a **client-server web application** built on Next.js App Router. The server layer handles page rendering and the contact form API. The client layer handles all interactivity, animations, and 3D rendering. Static content is decoupled from components entirely — it lives in typed TypeScript constants and plain text files, so no CMS or database is needed.

### Request lifecycle

When a visitor opens the site, Next.js renders the top-level page as a server component. It reads the bio paragraphs from `content/bio.txt` at request time and passes them as props down to the Hero section. All other sections receive their data from typed constants in `src/lib/data/` which are bundled at build time. Client components hydrate in the browser, starting scroll-triggered animations once each section enters the viewport.

When a visitor submits the contact form, the browser POSTs JSON to `/api/contact`. The route handler validates the payload, calls the Resend API with the visitor's message, and returns a success or error response. The form shows an animated success overlay on delivery.

## System Design

### Component architecture

The site is divided into five top-level sections, each self-contained in its own directory under `src/components/`:

**Navbar** handles theme toggling, accent colour selection, and responsive mobile navigation. The accent picker stores the user's selection in a React context that applies a class to the `<html>` element, switching the active CSS variable set.

**Hero** is the landing view. It contains a Three.js particle background, a rotating skill cube, an animated bio card, and a photo card. The bio text is server-read from `content/bio.txt`, making it editable without touching any component code.

**About** is split into three tabs: a narrative timeline of alternating photo and prose blocks, an experience zig-zag timeline, and an education year-selector with course banners. All content is data-driven from separate data files.

**Projects** renders a prioritised masonry grid. Each project card supports a live URL, a GitHub link, and a video demo link. Featured projects link to dedicated detail pages whose long-form body text is read from `content/projects/{slug}.txt` at build time.

**Contact** combines a VS Code-style typewriter terminal, a Resend-powered contact form, an interactive 3D globe with five North American city markers, and an animated meteor shower backdrop.

### Data flow

  CNST["lib/data/*.ts"] -->|imported at build| SC["Section Components
e.g. Hero, About, Projects, Contact"]
  BIO["content/bio.txt"] -->|readFileSync at request| PAGE["page.tsx server component"]
  PAGE -->|bio prop| BCARD["Hero - BioCard"]
  PROJ["content/projects/*.txt"] -->|readFileSync at build| DETAIL["Project detail pages"]
  FORM["Contact Form UI"] -->|fetch POST| ROUTE["api/contact handler"]
  ROUTE -->|Resend SDK| EMAIL["Email delivery"]
```

### Theming system

Every colour in the design is a CSS custom property defined on `:root` (light mode) and `.dark` (dark mode). Three accent themes are toggled by adding a class to `<html>`: `.accent-violet`, `.accent-cyan`, or `.accent-amber`. No component ever hardcodes a colour — they all reference `var(--accent)`, `var(--glass)`, `var(--fg)`, and so on.

### Animation strategy

Entry animations use Framer Motion `whileInView` with `once: true` so they fire once as each section scrolls into view. Complex choreography in the Hero section uses GSAP timelines for fine-grained sequencing. Mouse-driven parallax on accent orbs also uses GSAP for smooth interpolation. The 3D globe is a custom Three.js canvas rendered inside a React component with a `useEffect` lifecycle.

## Sections and Use Cases

### Hero

The hero section gives a first impression. The typewriter role cycle, animated bio card, and 3D particle background communicate personality and technical range at a glance. A visitor can immediately see the name, current role, and call-to-action buttons for the resume and contact section.

### About

The about section tells the story behind the resume. The narrative timeline walks through key life and academic moments with paired photos. The experience tab shows a zig-zag career timeline with company logos and bullet-point responsibilities. The education tab lets a visitor browse courses by year, giving context for academic depth. The hobbies tab adds a human dimension beyond professional credentials.

### Projects

The projects grid is the portfolio centrepiece. Projects are sorted by priority and then by recency. Featured projects take a wider card format. Each card shows a preview image, a short description, the technology tags, and links to the live site, source code, and video demo when available. Detail pages provide longer write-ups for significant projects.

### Contact

The contact section is the conversion point for recruiters and collaborators. It provides a direct email form powered by Resend, an interactive 3D globe that visualises the cities where the author is open to opportunities, and a VS Code terminal card that presents key profile information in a memorable format.

## Running the project

All commands needed to install, develop, build, lint, and deploy the site are documented in **[RUN.md](./RUN.md)**.

---

## Code quality

### Linting — ESLint

Next.js ships with ESLint pre-configured via `eslint-config-next`, which bundles the core-web-vitals ruleset and TypeScript-aware rules. The config lives in `eslint.config.mjs`. `eslint-config-prettier` is added last in the chain to disable any ESLint formatting rules that would conflict with Prettier — the two tools never fight each other.

Run `pnpm lint` to check the whole project (`eslint .`), or `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix what ESLint can resolve without human input. Note: `next lint` was replaced with a direct `eslint .` call because Next.js 16 changed the CLI to treat the first positional argument as a directory path.

### Formatting - Prettier

Prettier is the single source of truth for code style. Config lives in `.prettierrc`. The important choices: no semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas where valid, 100-character print width. `.prettierignore` excludes `.next/`, `node_modules/`, and `public/` so generated and binary files are never touched.

Run `pnpm format` to rewrite everything in place, or `pnpm format:check` to report without writing (useful in CI).

### Pre-commit enforcement - Husky & lint-staged

Husky installs a Git pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) during `pnpm install` via the `prepare` lifecycle script. The hook runs `lint-staged`, which applies ESLint and Prettier only to the files staged for the current commit — not the whole project — keeping the hook fast even as the codebase grows.

The `lint-staged` config in `package.json`:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
  "*.{js,mjs,json,css,md}": ["prettier --write"]
}
```

If ESLint reports an error it cannot auto-fix, the commit is blocked and git prints the offending rule. This makes it structurally impossible to commit broken or unformatted code.

## Discussion Points

**Separation of content from presentation.** Every visible string lives in a typed constant or a plain text file. A content change never requires touching a component. This also means the data layer is fully testable in isolation.

**Progressive enhancement and accessibility.** Animations use `once: true` so users who scroll past a section quickly do not see them repeat. All decorative elements carry `aria-hidden`. Semantic HTML landmarks are used for each section.

**CSS custom properties as the single source of theming truth.** Rather than relying on Tailwind generated classes for colours, the entire palette is expressed as custom properties. Tailwind utilities are used only for layout and spacing, which means the accent and theme system works across every component without per-component conditionals.

**Server-side file reads in an App Router context.** The bio and project detail texts are read with `readFileSync` inside async server components. This avoids a client-side fetch waterfall and keeps long-form prose editable without a rebuild cycle when used with ISR.

**Three.js inside React.** The globe is a custom Three.js canvas managed entirely in a `useEffect`. Cleanup on unmount disposes all geometries, materials, and the renderer to avoid memory leaks during hot-reloads in development.
